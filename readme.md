# Hotel-Review-Snalysis

Web-based travel scheduling and booking has become one of the major activities in our day to day life.

Hotel booking websites use online rating and customer input to support the decision-making process of the client, but reviews provide a better insight into the hotel. Most travelers do not have time or patience to read all reviews. This research analyzes the ratings of hotels and provides information that may not easily be captured by going through all the reviews.

The comments and metadata are crawled from the website and grouped according to some specific aspects into pre-defined categories. Here, we try to make efficient reviews analysis on “booking.com” hotel reviews and apply Natural Language Processing to pre-process the data. After that, the information in text is identified and classification is is done for each piece of data as positive, negative or neutral.

This pre-processed data is converted into a pie-chart and bar-chart by the use of the Django library. The chart is defined based on categories like room, food, cleanliness, service, staff, nature view, and facilities.

There is also an added feature for the user to select areas of interest to see a list of sorted reviews from the data set that has been extracted.
